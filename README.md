# NVBasic

Modern Solution to a Basic-Style Programming Language

Mainly written as support for RCbash's style init-scripts,
allowing for newer, more modernized init-scripts.

```basic

10 PRINTF "hello world!"
20 GOTO 10
30 GOTO 20

Output:

hello world!
hello world!
hello world!

```

## NVBSTD


The NVBasic library consists of 2 functions, GOTO, and PRINT.

"PRINT" Prints the first argument in the argument array, so

`PRINT hello world` = `hello`

"GOTO" is the standard & simplified GOTO function which allows you to run
statements already previously ran.

## Why?

To make something better than QBasic, and QBasic's API.
